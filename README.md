This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the pygame library. In this classic game, the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food, while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body.

🕹️ Game Features
Classic Snake Gameplay: Control a snake that moves around the screen to eat food and grow longer.

The objective is to eat as much food as possible to grow the snake without hitting the walls or the snake’s body.
The score increases as you eat more food.

🏆 Scoring
